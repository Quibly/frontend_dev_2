    <h2>Week 10</h2>
    <h3>Notes/Activities</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Client-side Validation</h4>
            <p>Client side validation is something I've taken care to do in my HTML forms so I'm pretty comfortable with that part.</p>
            <p>Client side validation with Javascript is different though. I'm less familiar with that.</p>
            <p>The 'validity' property seems to match the options available in HTML. That makes it easy. Using processes for legacy browsers seems pretty cumbersome.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Fetch() API</h4>
            <p>Fetch() gives me trouble from time to time because there are so many ways to use it. I seem to use it differently every time I go about it.</p>
            <p>I've used Headers in my backend classes. I don't really understand their purpose completely. Are they just a security/validation measure or do they have other purposes?</p>
        </li>
        <!-- <li>
            <p></p>
            <a href="" target="_blank"></a>
        </li> -->
    </ul>
    <h3>Questions</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Same one as I posted in the notes: Do headers serve another purpose besides security/validation?</p>
        </li>
