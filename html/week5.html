    <h2>Week 5</h2>
    <h3>Notes/Activities</h3>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="/frontend_dev_2/html/w05TeamActivity/index.html" target="_blank">W05 Team Activity</a>
            <p>This was a productive Team Activity. Most of us came prepared and everyone contributed to some aspect of the code.</p>
            <p>I worked on the stretch challenge after the team meeting because we used all of our time on the main topics.</p>
            <p>I took a little bit of a different approach on the stretch goal by creating a hovering Details List that displays where the mouse pointer is. I hope that is ok.</p>      
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Reading: Testing and Debugging</h3>
            <p>I tried turning on strict mode for the team activity code this week. It didn't add any issues or errors, which is good I guess. I'll be using it going forward.</p>
            <p>I think it's pretty neat how 'throw' works to provide the line and location of the error in the results.</p>
            <p>Jest seems a helpful tool but it also seems like building the test files would have to happen after you build the code. Is that really an efficient process?</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Questions </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>How much time is spent building test files in industrial processes? It seems like it take a lot of time to debug code this way when you are pretty much defining function callbacks twice.</p>
        </li>
