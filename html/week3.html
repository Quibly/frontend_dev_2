    <h3>Notes/Activities</h3>
    <p>I find object programming completely facinating. The flexibility and personality of objects is great.</p>
    <p>I've never seen the Object.entries() function for arrays. I think that could have simplified a lot of solutions for me in the past.</p>
    <p>DOM Object Model information was mostly review but still very informative for defining pros and cons of different options.</p>
    <p>EventListeners have always given me trouble in my code. This section was especially important to my understanding.</p>
    <p>The learning on Event Propagation and Event Delegation was all new to me. I gained a lot from the Events chapter.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="/frontend_dev_2/html/w03TeamActivity.html" target="_blank">W03 Team Activity</a>
            <p>We did this code as a team during our group assignment. We worked on the stretch challenges also.</p>
            <p>One key learning element we found was that the reduce() function has an option for defining the initialValue. This was powerful for question #8.</p>         
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="/frontend_dev_2/html/w03TeamActivityPart2.html" target="_blank">W03 Team Activity Part 2</a>
            <p>I worked on this code on my own after our team meeting.</p>
            <p>I found myself overcomplicating this and did well to simplify my functions and how they were all working together.</p>    
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="/frontend_dev_2/html/w03Reading/events.html" target="_blank">W03 Reading Activity</a>
            <p>This is some of my code example activity from the reading.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Questions </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>As I was going through the reading for the DOM it instructed to manipulate the DOM of a blank Heroes page with the console. Where was that found? (Nevermind. I found it. It was right at the beginning. Ugh.)</li>
        <li>Why do EventListeners call the function when they are set using parentheses at the end of the function name?</li>
    </ul>
